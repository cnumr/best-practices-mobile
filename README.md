# Mobile-specific Best Practices

This guide is aimed at developers for mobile platforms who want to make their apps more sustainable, that is, both ecologically and socially acceptable. Unlike general rules of thumb, this guide is focused on **code smells**, that is surface symptoms that suggest there might be a
problem, or that there might be a better way of writing the code. Therefore, these low-level best practices offer the great advantage of being detectable by program analysis tools, such as [ecoCode Mobile](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecoCode-mobile).
