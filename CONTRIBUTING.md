# Contribute to this mobile-specific guide

Any native mobile developer (Android or iOS) is invited to contribute to this guide of best practices, provided they follow the procedure.

As mobile platforms evolve very quickly, this guide requires contributions from as many people as possible to stay up-to-date.

## Submit a New Best Practice

Ranging from vague advices (e.g. *avoid too much videos*) to seemingly simple only (e.g. *avoid autoplay in videos*, *avoid infinite scroll*), finding best practices that are **statically detectable** is a real headache.

But if you can think of a eco-friendly practice that can be useful to many people, open a `Pull Request`. Please tag your PR with `android` or  `iOS`, as appropriate. If possible, provide a *short name* and a *detailed description* with clear references to elements of the APIs. Anyway, your PR will probably yield a fruitful discussion.

## Report a Best Practice

If you notice something wrong with an existing practice, open an `Issue`. Please tag your issue with `android` or  `iOS`, as appropriate. The title of your issue must refer to the practice concerned as follows: *category-name* (e.g. *Environmental-Charge Awareness*, or *Social-Google consent*)

## Validation of a Practice

As things stand, best practices mainly rely on common-sense and consensus. Optimally, each new practice should be accompanied by a proof-of-impact on sustainability. At this stage we suggest [PowDroid](https://gitlab.com/powdroid), a lightweight tool to measure energy consumption of apps running on android-powered devices.
