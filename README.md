# Mobile-specific Best Practices

This guide is aimed at developers for mobile platforms who want to make their apps more sustainable, that is, both ecologically and socially acceptable. Unlike general rules of thumb, this guide is focused on **code smells**, that is surface symptoms in the codebase that indicate something to be done better. Therefore, these low-level best practices offer the huge advantage of being detectable by code scanners.
